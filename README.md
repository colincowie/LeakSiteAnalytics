# Leak Site Analytics

This repository contains a collection of scripts that use Plotly to perform data visualization of ransomware leak site postings.

- [Bar Graph](https://github.com/colincowie/LeakSiteAnalytics/blob/master/bar_graph.py)
- [Heatmap](https://github.com/colincowie/LeakSiteAnalytics/blob/master/heatmap.py)
- [Scatter Graph](https://github.com/colincowie/LeakSiteAnalytics/blob/master/scatter_graph.py)


## Acknowledgments
The raw data used is provided by [RansomWatch]((https://ransomwatch.telemetry.ltd).

OpenAI's [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) was involved the production of these scripts.

## Usage

The most recent leak site data from RansomWatch can downloaded for their repository:
- [https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/posts.json](https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/main/posts.json)

`posts.json` must be placed into the `LeakSiteAnalytics` folder for these scripts to work.
